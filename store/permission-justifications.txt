Permission Justifications — Claude Usage Tracker

cookies:
Read claude.ai session cookies to authenticate requests to the Claude.ai usage API endpoint. The extension needs the user's existing session cookies to call https://claude.ai/api/organizations/{orgId}/usage on their behalf. Cookies are only read from the claude.ai domain and only sent back to claude.ai.

alarms:
Poll the Claude.ai usage endpoint every 5 minutes to keep the displayed utilization data and toolbar badge up to date. Uses chrome.alarms.create with a 5-minute period.

storage:
Persist usage data (API response cache), the user's card display order preference, and notification threshold flags across browser sessions using chrome.storage.local. All data is stored locally on the user's device.

notifications:
Display desktop alerts when the user's top priority usage metric crosses 50%, 75%, or 90% utilization thresholds. Helps users stay aware of their Claude usage limits before they are reached.

host_permissions (https://claude.ai/*):
Required for two purposes: (1) reading cookies from the claude.ai domain via chrome.cookies.getAll, and (2) making fetch requests to the claude.ai usage API endpoint. No other domains are accessed.
